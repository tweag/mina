# Mina

Mina is the first cryptocurrency with a lightweight, constant-sized blockchain. This is the main source code repository for the Mina project. It contains code for the OCaml protocol implementation, [website](https://minaprotocol.com), & wallet. Enjoy!

## Notes

- Mina is still under active development, and APIs are still evolving. If you do build upon the APIs, be aware that breaking changes may occur.
